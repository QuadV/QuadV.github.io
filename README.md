##### *I love learning and exploring new things*

> Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
>
> And that is what I like about it.
>
> After years of writing codes to manipulate patterns found in data, I came across this new inverse approach of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
>
> This notebook records my small footsteps in exploring the vast domain of machine learning.
