##### *I love learning and exploring new things*

> Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
>
> And that is what I like about it.
>
> After years of writing codes to manipulate patterns found in data, I came across this new inverse approach of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
>
> This notebook records my small footsteps in exploring the vast domain of machine learning.

#### My Work

##### Concepts

1. [Linear Discriminant Analysis](<https://viona91.github.io/workbook.html?name=LDA_iPython>)
2. [Principal Component Analysis](<https://viona91.github.io/workbook.html?name=PCA_iPython>)

##### Models

1. [Fashion MNIST Classification using Keras](<https://viona91.github.io/workbook.html?name=1BasicClassification>)
2. [Single Layer Neural Network from Scratch](<https://viona91.github.io/workbook.html?name=SingleLayerNN>) (GitHub project link - [here](<https://github.com/Viona91/Basic-Classification-neural-network-model-using-Keras>))
